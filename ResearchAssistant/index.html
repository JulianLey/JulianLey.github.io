        Since June 15, 2024, I have been employed by KTH as a research assistant. 
        Initially, I worked on a group project during a software development course at KTH to create a model of a Stockholm subway station. 
        After the course ended, I was hired to continue developing and refining this model further, allowing me to expand and enhance the original project.
